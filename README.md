# Cursed.dll plugin port for H3VR

This is a collection of plugins that port all the functionalities of the original 
Cursed DLLs into Harmony patches.

The main benefits of this collection are

* All patches are applied at runtime without permanently modifying the original game assemblies
    * That means the patches survive game updates much better
* All patches are separated into plugins, so it's possible to choose the only features that you want
